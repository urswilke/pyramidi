The goal of pyramidi is to read in dataframes generated by the python package
[miditapyr](https://pypi.org/project/miditapyr/). These dataframes contain midi data. Then the midi information (one
line per event) can be translated into a wide format (one line per note). This 
facilitates plotting piano roll plots. These dataframes can then be written back
to midi files (again using miditapyr).

Thus you can manipulate these dataframes at all steps and write midi files from R. You need to make sure yourself that the midi files you write can be understood by your softsynth; but [mido](https://github.com/mido/mido) (used by miditapyr) already catches some of the possible inconsistencies.

*I started to write these packages quite some time ago. They are sometimes not very well designed. For now `miditapyr` only contains one module with functions. And the functionality of `pyramidi` is quite limited and necessitates a lot of manual intermediate steps. But the loose structure allows you to generate & manipulate midi data on many different levels.* 

## Installation

You can install pyramidi from [github](https://github.com/urswilke/pyramidi) with:

``` r
## install remotes package if it's not already
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

## install dev version of rtweettree from github
remotes::install_github("UrsWilke/pyramidi")
```

The python package [miditapyr](https://pypi.org/project/miditapyr/) also needs to be installed via 

```sh
pip install miditapyr
```

in your python environment used by [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate).

But if everything works as it should ðŸ¤žðŸ˜…, miditapyr is automatically installed
if you install pyramidi, as soon as you access the module for the first time. (I'm not sure if that works on windows too. Perhaps there you have to configure your reticulate environment manually.)

Otherwise, you can also install it
in your reticulate python environment
with the included helper function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pyramidi::install_miditapyr()
```


## Basic usage

### Load libraries

First load some libraries:

```{r load_libs, message=FALSE}
library(pyramidi)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(zeallot)
```

### Extract midi file information into dataframe


```{r midi_df}
midi_file_str <- system.file("extdata", "test_midi_file.mid", package = "pyramidi")

midifile <- mido$MidiFile(midi_file_str)
ticks_per_beat <- midifile$ticks_per_beat
```

Now we can load the information of the `midifile` into a dataframe:

```{r midi_df2, message=FALSE}
dfc = miditapyr$midi_to_df(midifile)
head(dfc, 20)
```

This dataframe contains the columns of the track index `i_track`, `meta` (whether the midi event is a note event), and `msg` containing named lists of further midi event information.

The `MidiFile()` function of `mido` also yields the [`ticks_per_beat`](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/midi_files.html#tempo-and-beat-resolution) of the file:

```{r ticksperbeat}
ticks_per_beat
```

The `miditapyr$tidy_df()` function transforms the `msg` column of the dataframe to a wide format, where every new column name corresponds to the names in the lists in `msg`  (like `tidyr::unnest_wider()`):

```{r}
df <- miditapyr$tidy_df(dfc) %>% as_tibble()
head(df, 20)
```

Except the `name` column this seems to be the same as 
```{r}
dfc %>% unnest_wider(msg)
```

### Translate midi time information

In the midi format, time is treated as relative increments between events (measured in ticks). 
In order to derive the total time passed, you can use the function `tab_measures()`:


```{r}
dfm <- tab_measures(df, ticks_per_beat) %>%
  # create a variable `track` with the track name (in order to have it in the plot below)
  mutate(track = ifelse(purrr::map_chr(name, typeof) != "character", 
                        list(NA_character_), 
                        name)) %>%
  unnest(cols = track) %>% 
  fill(track)

dfm
```

This function adds further columns:

* `ticks`: specifying the total ticks passed,
* `t`: specifying the total time in seconds passed,
* `m`: specifying the total [measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music)) (bars) passed,
* `b`: specifying the total [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)) passed,
* `i_note`: unique ascending index for every track and midi note in the midi file.

### Further processing of the midi events

You can split the dataframe in two by whether the events are [meta](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta_message_types.html) or not:

```{r}
dfm %>% 
    miditapyr$split_df() %->% c(df_meta, df_notes)
```

```{r df_meta}
df_meta %>% as_tibble()
```


```{r df_notes}
df_notes %>% as_tibble()
```



### Pivot note dataframe to wide

Each note in the midi file is characterized by a `note_on` and a `note_off` event.
In order to generate a piano roll plot with ggplot2, we need to `tidyr::pivot_wider()` those events.
This can be done with the function `widen_events()`:

```{r df_notes_wide}
df_not_notes <- 
  df_notes %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!stringr::str_detect(.data$type, "^note_o[nf]f?$")) 

df_notes_wide <-
  df_notes %>% 
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(.data$type, "^note_o[nf]f?$")) %>%
  # tab_measures(df_meta, df_notes, ticks_per_beat) %>%
  widen_events() %>%
  left_join(pyramidi::midi_defs)
df_notes_wide
```
In the new format, the data has half the number of rows.
The columns `m`, `b`, `t`, `ticks`, `time` and `velocity` are each replaced by
two columns with the suffix `_note_on` and `_note_off`.


### Plot the midi file information in a piano roll plot

Now we have the midi data in the right format for the piano roll plot:

```{r midi_piano_roll}
df_notes_wide %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      x = m_note_on,
      y = note_name,
      xend = m_note_off,
      yend = note_name,
      color = velocity_note_on
    )
  ) +
  # each midi track is printed into its own facet:
  facet_wrap( ~ track,
              ncol = 1,
              scales = "free_y") + 
  guides(color=guide_colorbar(title="Note velocity")) +
  labs(
    title = "Piano roll of the note events in the midi file",
    subtitle = "Only notes played are shown."
  ) +
  xlab("Measures") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 16, 4),
                     minor_breaks = 0:16) +
  scale_colour_gradient() +
  theme_minimal()

```

### Manipulation of the midi data

The new format also allows to easily manipulate the midi data. For instance, let's put the volume (called `velocity` in midi) of the first beat in every bar to the maximum (127), and to half of its original value otherwise:


```{r}
df_notes_wide_mod <- df_notes_wide %>% 
  mutate(
    velocity_note_on = ifelse(
      # As it's a 4/4 beat, the first beat of each bar is a multiple of 4:
      b_note_on %% 4 == 0, 
      127, 
      velocity_note_on / 2
    )
)
```

Let's compare the modified value to the original one:

```{r}
df_notes_wide %>% 
  select(b_note_on, velocity_note_on) %>% 
  bind_cols(
    new = df_notes_wide_mod$velocity_note_on
  )
            


```

With an `ifelse()` statement, we modified the volume of the midi notes, depending on if they're the first beat in the measure or not. 

Other possible manipulations could be for instance:

* [Quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(music)) by `round()`ing the `note_on`/`note_off` times,
* Chord generation, e.g. by applying a `group_by(floor(m_note_on))`-`summarize()` logic, or
* Arpeggiating chords by a `group_by(floor(m_note_on))` - `mutate()` logic.

### Pivot note data frame back to long format

We can transform the wide midi data back to the long format:

```{r pivot_long}
df_notes_out <-
  df_notes_wide %>%
  select(c("i_track",
           "channel", "note", "i_note"), matches("_note_o[nf]f?$")) %>%
  pivot_longer(matches("_note_o[nf]f?$"),
               names_to = c(".value", "type"),
               names_pattern = "(.+?)_(.*)") %>%
  # note events are not meta events (cf.
  # https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/midi_files.html?highlight=meta#meta-messages):
  mutate(meta = FALSE)
```


### Join non note events

We can now add the non note events:

```{r join_non_note_events}
df_notes_out <-
  df_notes_out %>%
  full_join(df_meta) %>%
  full_join(df_not_notes) %>%
  # It is important to put the events in the right order:
  arrange(i_track, ticks) %>%
  group_by(i_track) %>%
  # Now we can calculate the time increments between events;
  # The first event of each track is set to 0:
  mutate(time = ticks - lag(ticks) %>% {.[1] = 0; .}) %>%
  ungroup()

df_notes_out
```

The `time` value in midi format is given by the number of `ticks` passed between events.

### Write midi dataframe back to a midi file

Now we can transform the data back to a dataframe of the same format as the one we got with `miditapyr$midi_to_df()`:
```{r dfc2}
dfc2 <-
  df_notes_out %>%
  # For midi export the new columns are removed:
  select(names(df)) %>%
  # When reticulate converts R dataframes to pandas, there are complications
  # with character columns containing missing values.
  # repair_reticulate_conversion = TRUE, repairs that in the miditapyr python
  # code:
  miditapyr$compact_df(repair_reticulate_conversion = TRUE)
dfc2 %>% as_tibble()
```

And we can save it back to a midi file:

```{r write_midi, eval=FALSE}
dfc2 %>%
  miditapyr$df_to_midi(ticks_per_beat,
                "test.mid")
```


## Related R packages

* The [noon package](https://github.com/ColinFay/noon) wraps node.js libraries and can be used to read live midi input port data. I wrote a small [blog post](https://urssblogg.netlify.app/post/2020-10-24-live-recording-of-a-midi-controller-via-mido-inport/) how reading a midi port can also be done in R with [mido](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ports.html). Interestingly, the node.js libraries and mido rely on a the same C++ library [RtMidi](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/index.html). 
* The [tuneR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tuneR) package can also read in midi data. See the [vignette](https://urswilke.github.io/pyramidi/articles/tuner.html), for an example how you can transform the tuner format into the pyramidi format (or run `vignette("tuner", package = "pyramidi")` to load the vignette on your machine).

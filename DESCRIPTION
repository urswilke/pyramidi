Description: This package uses the python libraries miditapyr based on mido (and music21) to put midi file data in pandas DataFrames. These can be imported in R. The event-based midi data is widened to facilitate the manipulation and plotting of note-based structures as in music21. The data frame format allows for an easy implementation of many music data manipulations.
